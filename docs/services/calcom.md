## What is Calcom

Scheduling infrastructure for everyone.

## Deploying on x86 (amd64)

You need to change default docker compose to the following to make cal.com work on x86 (amd64):

```yaml
services:
  calcom:
    image: 'calcom/cal.com:<VERSION compatible with amd64>
    platform: linux/amd64
    (... same ...)
```

You can check the latest amd64 compatible version [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/calcom/cal.com/tags).

Example:

```yaml
services:
  calcom:
    image: 'calcom/cal.com:v5.9.0
    platform: linux/amd64
    (... same ...)
```
